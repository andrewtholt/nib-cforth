1)	$delete ( c-addr n --- c-addr n ..... count )
		( c-addr n --- 1 )

If more than one record matches selection criteria return the key for
each and the count.  If a unique match remove the record and return the 
number of records deleted (1).

2)	delete key

Need a mechanism for allowing quotes e.g. delete "ANDREW HOLT" or 
some way of saying select records that match a logical condition and return
record count e.g. return

n n1 n2 n3 4 then have a command delete-all which removes each on turn

OK, in tst.fth I have added a number of words to deal with LIFO list.

So if I do a search each match is added to a Q.

A second search adds to a second list.

A conditional test places on the result list only thos records from the first
and second that match the selection criteria (and, xor, or ).

A forth list exists to hold released entries.  These can be used by subsequent
searches.

e.g. (psuedo code)

find(list_head)

find-first
if found
  add to list
else
  exit
then

while (find-next)
  add to list
end
